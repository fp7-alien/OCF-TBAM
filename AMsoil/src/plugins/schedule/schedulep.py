class Schedule(object):
    """
    
    Please create one instance of this class for each schedule_subject.
    What is a schedule_subject? There is one schedule for each resource classification/type.
    Conceptionally, two different subjects mean distinct databases.
    Example:
    find... -> 2 results
    find... -> 1 result
    
    Describe resource_id (e.g. the IP as string) to later find the record for a specific resource (e.g. IP).
    
    The schedule plugin can be used in two ways.
    - Either as best-effort booking system, which can not handle future reservations, but only reservations starting from now.
    - Or it can be used as pre-booking reservation system. In the latter case, the {start_time} parameter can be given to methods.
    
    Reservation booking constraints:
    - There shall never be _two_ reservations for the same subject and resource_id at any given time.
      Examples (pseudocode):
      ipSchedule = Schedule("IP")
      vmSchedule = Schedule("VM")
      ipSchedule.reserve(..., '192.168.10.1', datetime.utcnow())
      ipSchedule.reserve(..., '192.168.10.1', datetime.utcnow()) # ERROR
    
    Reservation value objects:
    Are of class AttributeDict. Behave like dicts but the keys can also be accessed/mutated as properties.
    You can use the str() method to see all info about one reservation.
    Example:
    
    The following parameters are parameters to methods of this class:
    - reservation_id (int) managed internally, can be used to identify specific a reservation record.
    - resource_id str (should be string)
    - resource_spec pickle, optional (should be a dict), can be nested but please do not include objects (except you are sure how pickle serialization works)
    - user_id str, optional
    - slice_urn str, optional (can be empty, slice's name, a uuid, or however you distiguish experiments)
    - start_time datetime, optional (defaults to `utcnow()`)
    - end_time datetime, optional (init's {default_duration} (number in seconds) If no {end_time} is given in subsequent methods, this value will be added to the {start_time} to get the end of the reservation.)
    
    For specifying time always use the pyhton class datetime. UTC is assumed as timezone.
    
    TODO
    - create wiki page for documentation
    - create slides for documentation
    - What happens with expiry?
    
    NOTE:
    This class will never deliver a Database record to the outside.
    It will copy the contents of the database record, so the plugin user can not accidentally change the database.
